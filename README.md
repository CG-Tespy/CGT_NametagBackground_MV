# CGT_NameTagBackground_MV
Lets you use a whole image as the background graphic of a nametag, instead of having it drawn from a window.png

You can also customize the width, height, opacity, etc of the background graphic. See the User Guide included in the latest release for more details.

If you are using this in one of your projects, I would very much appreciate it if you'd let me know. Just send me an email at gbcabreracgt@gmail.com
